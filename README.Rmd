> Non-parametric Causal Effects Based on Longitudinal Modified Treatment Policies

# Installation

The development version can be installed from GitHub with: 

```r
devtools::install_github("nt-williams/lmtp")
```

# Example

We're interested in the effect of an intervention where exposure is decreased by 1 at all time points for observations whose exposure won't go below 0 if shifted on the outcome Y. The true value under this intervention is about 0.48.
