\title{lmtp: Non-parametric Causal Effects Based on Longitudinal Modified Treatment Policies}
\description{
Cross-validated estimators for casual effects based on longitudinal modified treatment 
  policies (INSERT PAPER CITATION) and traditional point treatment and longitudinal effects. 
  Both continuous and binary treatments are allowed as well as censored outcomes. The treatment 
  mechanism is estimated via a density ratio classification procedure whether treatment is continuous or binary. 
  Estimation is performed using the Super Learner from `sl3`. For both continuous and binary outcomes, additive 
  treatment effects can be calculated and relative risks and odds ratios may be calculated for binary 
  outcomes.
