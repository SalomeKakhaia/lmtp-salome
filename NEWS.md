# lmtp 1.0.0.9000

-   Now relies on the **SuperLearner** package for estimation.
-   Survival outcome now estimates survival probability instead of cumulative incidence. This fixes a bug with IPW and survival problems.
-   Outcome type now accepts "survival" for explicit indication of a survival outcome (issue \#76).
-   New `.trimming` parameter for trimming extreme density ratios.
-   New `.SL_folds` parameter that controls the splits used for fitting the SuperLearner (issue \#84).
-   New `.return_all_ratios` parameter that allows for returning non-cumulative product density ratios to the user.
-   `bound` parameter renamed to `.bound`.
-   **slider** dependency removed.
-   **data.table** added as a dependency.
-   `event_locf()` speed greatly improved (issue \#80).
-   Fixed a bug that outputted outcome regressions and density ratios in incorrect order compared to the original data.
-   Fixed a bug in the missing data check that threw an error for missing data after an observation experiences the outcome.
-   Fixed a bug that resulted in `NA` censoring indicators throwing an error for missing data.
-   Fixed a bug about `values()` being deprecated in the **future** package (issue \#82).
-   Fixed a warning from the **future** package regarding random number generation (issue \#81).
-   Fixed `create_node_list()` returns description (issue \#77).
-   Migrated continuous integration from Travis-CI to GitHub Actions.
-   Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
-   License change to GPL-3.
